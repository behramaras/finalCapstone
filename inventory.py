"""
This code was written for the Nike warehouse.
The store manager can manage the warehouse and view the stock status of the products.
However, you can search for a product using the product code, identify and restock the product with the lowest stock,
find the product with the highest stock, and access the total values of all products separately,
and display all products with all their features.

# 'get quantity' module returns the quantity of the shoe.
