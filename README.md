## Project Name
finalCapstone

## Description
This code was written for the Nike warehouse.
The store manager can manage the warehouse and view the stock status of the products.
However, the store manager can search for a product using the product code, identify and restock the product with the lowest stock,
find the product with the highest stock, and access the total values of all products separately, and display all products with all their features.

*inventory.txt* file contains examples for Shoe objects to be created in the code.

## Installation
Use the green "Code" button to download the files. You can choose what way you want to download the files in "Local" section.


## Usage
